ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* default.properties
* lib\
* lib\commons-net-2.2.jar

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => fTPClient\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => fTPClient\src\main\assets
* libs\Ad_Android_SDK.jar => fTPClient\libs\Ad_Android_SDK.jar
* libs\commons-net-3.3.jar => fTPClient\libs\commons-net-3.3.jar
* lint.xml => fTPClient\lint.xml
* res\ => fTPClient\src\main\res\
* src\ => fTPClient\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
